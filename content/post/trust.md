Don Bosco maintained that “it is not possible to educate youngsters if they have no trust in their superiors.”

Only if the pupils trust the educator will they open themselves to him/her.  Trust is gained by eliminating whatever alienates the pupils from the educator.  The educator can do this by going to the pupils first, adapting to their tastes and becoming one like them.
