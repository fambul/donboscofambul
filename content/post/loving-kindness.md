Don Bosco used to adivse the directors of Salesian institutions: “Try to make yourself loved rather than feared” The love that he had in mind was a spiritually mature, impartial, generous, selfless and self-sacrificing love.  In the Letter from Rome (1884) he mentions love 27 times (The letter has 3,693 words).  The youngsters must be made to feel that they are loved.  He says: “The youngsters should not only be loved, but they themselves should know that they are loved.”
