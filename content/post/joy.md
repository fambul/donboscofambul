One of the secrets of the good running of the oratory mentioned by Don Bosco was: “happiness, singing, music and great freedom in amusements.”

Don Caviglia, an authority on Don Bosco says, “Don Bosco was able to see the part of joy in formation and in the life of sanctity, and wanted that gaiety and good humour should reign among his people.  Servite Domino in laetitia (Serve the Lord in joy) could be called the 11th commandment in Don Bosco’s house.”
