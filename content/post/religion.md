Don Bosco based his educational method on the Catholic faith tradition and believed that faith in Jesus Christ and commitment to the Church were needed not only for spiritual growth but also for one’s human, psychological, and intellectual growth.  He also placed lot of importance on religious practices. 

However, once (February 1878) he explained his educational method to Minister of the Interior Francesco Crispi, without making any reference to religion.  “The reason for this might be sought in the ‘political’ situation, or even in Don Bosco’s conviction that young people at risk could be helped by the method of reason and loving-kindness, even without reference to religion.”
