![A Unique Synthesis of Don Bosco](/images/salesians2.jpg)The Preventive System can be said to be the sum total of the convictions of Don Bosco, based on his long experience of nearly fifty years of working with the young at risk, which found expression in a specific style of relating, that he used for dealing constructively and effectively with youth to make them God-oriented persons and responsible citizens. Although at the request of different people he wrote short texts explaining his system at various times, the tenets of the system are contained in his 47 year experience of working with young at risk rather than in any one text. 

* reason 
* religion 
* loving-kindness 
* familiarity as in a family 
* trust 
* joy 
* accompaniment (assistance)
* prevention 
* respect for the individual
* and lack of corporal punishments

A word of explanation of each of these elements is needed to see what exactly Don Bosco meant by them.
