![Assistance](/images/salesians3.jpg)Assistance has two meanings in the writings of Don Bosco:

1. meeting all the real needs of young people like food, clothing, shelter and lodging, a job, education, good use of free time; and 
1. educator’s vigilance and ‘presence’ to the young.  
So assistance is ‘presence’ and ‘availability’ of the educator to the young person “for everything that was needed, in any particular educational situation.  Obviously this includes ‘supervision’ when needed, especially in a boarding school setting.”

Don Bosco placed great emphasis on the presence of the educator with the pupils especially during recreation.
