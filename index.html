		<p>Don Bosco was of the opinion that young people make mistakes not out of malice but due to lack of guidance and thoughtlessness.  If punishments are inflicted harshly they do not forget them easily and seek to take revenge.  Therefore, if possible, it is better not to have recourse to punishments.  But if punishment becomes inevitable they should be done privately, with love, prudence and patience.  However, certain punishments like striking someone, pulling someone’s ears, making someone kneel and other such punishments are to be avoided absolutely.</p>

<p>In his short work entitled “The Preventive System in the Education of the Young,” Don Bosco says that “there are two systems which have been in use through all ages in the education of youth: the preventive and the repressive.” So the preventive system is not totally a creation of Don Bosco.  Many of the elements that he considered as integral to his system were already mentioned by others. What is perhaps specific to Don Bosco is the genial way in which he combined various elements to give the already existing rudimentary system a new physiognomy.</p>

		<p>Don Bosco held that humans are created in the image and likeness of God. Because of this among all material beings humans alone intelligence and will and thus the capacity to love one another and to relate to God.  Therefore they have a dignity and worth which other material things do not have.  This is to be manifested in the way we deal with the young: “Let us treat young people as we would treat Jesus if he were a pupil in one of our schools.  Let us treat them with love, and they will love us in return.  Let us treat them with respect, and they will respect us in return.  They themselves must come to acknowledge us as the educators-in-charge.”</p>

		<p>Don Bosco said that his educational system, “places the pupils in the impossibility of committing faults.”</p>

<p>Prevention has two functions:</p>

<p>positively, it offers support to the young person to grow by offering a healthy atmosphere;
defensively, it protects the young from falling into situations of risk.
“Preventive activity to be educational must include:</p>

<p>foreseeing the youngster’s psychological moment;
allowing calculated and responsible risks; and
trust in youthful idealism and sense of responsibility.”
When practiced in this way prevention will offer the young person adequate opportunity to make free decisions while at the same time protecting them from damaging experiences, which especially at their age of psychological development, can become  insurmountable obstacles for their growth.</p>

<p><img src="http://fambul.github.io/donboscofambul/images/boys---education.jpg" alt="Boys Education" />
For some the word ‘preventive’ might have a negative connotation.  To understand and appreciate its sense as used by Don Bosco, “one should perhaps think of the way the word is used currently in the phrase ‘preventive medicine’.  Don Bosco’s method of education was ‘preventive’ in so far as he sought to create a healthy environment within which the personalities of his boys could unfold and develop.  He tried to ensure by prudent foresight that they were not exposed to moral dangers which they were still too immature to face.  Like a good doctor he believed not in trying to patch up remedies when things had gone wrong, but in seeking to ensure physical and moral well-being by a positively healthy environment.”
It is doubtful whether Don Bosco used the term ‘preventive system’ for his educational method before 1877.  Most probably he adopted this term in order to locate his method within the general classification of educational systems in his day and thus give it a scientific temper.</p>

Assistance has two meanings in the writings of Don Bosco:</p>

<ol>
<li>meeting all the real needs of young people like food, clothing, shelter and lodging, a job, education, good use of free time; and</li>
<li>educator’s vigilance and ‘presence’ to the young.<br />
So assistance is ‘presence’ and ‘availability’ of the educator to the young person “for everything that was needed, in any particular educational situation.  Obviously this includes ‘supervision’ when needed, especially in a boarding school setting.”</li>
</ol>

<p>Don Bosco placed great emphasis on the presence of the educator with the pupils especially during recreation.</p>

		<p>One of the secrets of the good running of the oratory mentioned by Don Bosco was: “happiness, singing, music and great freedom in amusements.”</p>

<p>Don Caviglia, an authority on Don Bosco says, “Don Bosco was able to see the part of joy in formation and in the life of sanctity, and wanted that gaiety and good humour should reign among his people.  Servite Domino in laetitia (Serve the Lord in joy) could be called the 11th commandment in Don Bosco’s house.”</p>

		<p>Don Bosco maintained that “it is not possible to educate youngsters if they have no trust in their superiors.”</p>

<p>Only if the pupils trust the educator will they open themselves to him/her.  Trust is gained by eliminating whatever alienates the pupils from the educator.  The educator can do this by going to the pupils first, adapting to their tastes and becoming one like them.</p>

&ldquo;Familiarity for Don Bosco meant family-style relationships and a home-like way of living and working together.  Its result is the family spirit.&rdquo; Don Bosco, except in official documents, preferred to refer to his institutions as house, this house, the house of the oratory, etc.  He wanted his institutions to be like a home and the people living and working/studying there to relate to one another as members of a family: “Every youngster who comes to a house of ours should regard his companions as brothers, and his superiors as those who take the place of his parents.”</p>

<p>To speak of the educator-pupil relationship in terms of father-son relationship was quite common. While there was affection in this relationship, this traditional relationship was characterized by aloofness and severity on the part of the educator and awe and respectful distance on the part of the pupil.</p>

<p>Don Bosco wanted the educational relationship to have all the characteristics of the various relationships (father-child, mother-child, brother/sister-brother/sister) in a family.  Thus he wanted the educator to have the qualities of a father (demanding), mother (tender-loving care) and brother/sister (equality, friendship). At the Oratory, for a long time, there were also mother figures like Mamma Margaret, Marianna Occhiena, Mrs. Rua, Mrs. Gastaldi, Mrs. Bellia, and others.</p>

		<p>Don Bosco used to adivse the directors of Salesian institutions: “Try to make yourself loved rather than feared” The love that he had in mind was a spiritually mature, impartial, generous, selfless and self-sacrificing love.  In the Letter from Rome (1884) he mentions love 27 times (The letter has 3,693 words).  The youngsters must be made to feel that they are loved.  He says: “The youngsters should not only be loved, but they themselves should know that they are loved.”</p>

		<p>Don Bosco based his educational method on the Catholic faith tradition and believed that faith in Jesus Christ and commitment to the Church were needed not only for spiritual growth but also for one’s human, psychological, and intellectual growth.  He also placed lot of importance on religious practices.</p>

<p>However, once (February 1878) he explained his educational method to Minister of the Interior Francesco Crispi, without making any reference to religion.  “The reason for this might be sought in the ‘political’ situation, or even in Don Bosco’s conviction that young people at risk could be helped by the method of reason and loving-kindness, even without reference to religion.”</p>

<li>Arthur Lenti, a specialist on Don Bosco says that “reason may be defined as justice, in the sense that the educator, as well as the youngster, is subject to the rule… rights and obligations must be constantly respected and lived up to by everybody;”</li>
<li>Reasonableness, that is everything that is asked of the young must be proportionate to their age and possible for them, especially with regard to work assignment and discipline;</li>
<li>Rationality, that is the reason for the decisions and demands as well as the good that is expected to result from them must be made evident to the young; and</li>
<li>Motivation, that is motivation should be created in the young to follow the educational programme that is proposed to them and their cooperation and participation in it must be elicited.</li>
